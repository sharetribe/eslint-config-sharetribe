# Sharetribe ESLint configuration

This package provides Sharetribe's shared [ESLint](http://eslint.org/) configuration. It extends the [eslint-config-airbnb](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/tree/master/packages/eslint-config-airbnb) configuration by disabling many rules related to style and syntax and loosens some errors into warnings.

This enables using the configuration in a hot loading environment like an application created with [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/) together with an automatic style and syntax formatter like [Prettier](https://github.com/jlongster/prettier).
